# AilenWorld Python bot
 
## !Do not use, it is for educational purposes!

I had to confirm an email authentication at some point and that's why I solved it with imap, at the beginning this authentication is not required.

the bot opens the main website and clicks play, then confirms an email authentication in a popup window,
after which it logs into my account in the same window. In a second window appears an approve button to allow the connection to the Wax Wallet, 
which must also be clicked. Then the normal web page loads, where it starts to mine in a certain time interval.

Although the project was very simple it was still really a lot of fun
